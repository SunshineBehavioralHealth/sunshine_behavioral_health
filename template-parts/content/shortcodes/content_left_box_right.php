People struggling with addictions might think that it’s impossible to stop using drugs and alcohol, but it is.

The centers of Sunshine Behavioral Health use medication, therapy, sobriety support groups, and other approaches to treat addictions and identify what causes them.

Residential treatment removes people from such causes. It teaches clients how to stay healthy and avoid relapses.

Our centers offer science-based treatment and compassionate care. They ensure that their clients aren’t alone as they start their recovery journey. They help people stop using and start living.
